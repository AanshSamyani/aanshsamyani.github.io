## **Why this blog?**
This is my first blog post where I try to learn and write blog posts using Markdown. I am writing this blog to assist me later to markdown basics and write more blog posts. Markdown is like the cool kid of the formatting world—simple, clean, and totally no-frills. It’s a lightweight markup language that lets you style text without drowning in buttons or menus. 
Need **bold text**? Just wrap it in a couple of asterisks. 

- Want a list? Start with a dash or a number, and you’re done. 
- Markdown is proof that sometimes, less really *is* more.

## **Headings**
Markdown has **six** levels of headings, which are created using the `#` symbol, as the number of **`#`' s** increase the size of the text decreases just like in HTML. This is what the headers look like:


# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6


## **Bold**
**This text is bold** - To make some text appear bold, we wrap the text between double
`*` (**asterisks**) or double `_` (**underscores**).

## *Italics*
*This text is Italics* - To make some text appear in italics, we wrap the text between 
a single `*` (*asterisk*) or a single `_` (*underscore*).

## <u>Underline</u>
<u>This text is underlined</u> - To underline text, wrap the text inside `<u>`
(<u>Opening</u>) and `<\u>` (<u>Closing</u>) HTML Tag.  

## ~~Strikethrough~~
~~This text is cancelled~~ - To strikethrough text, wrap the text between 
double `~` (~~tilde~~)

## <mark>Highlight</mark>  
<mark>This text is highlighted</mark> - To highlight text, wrap the text
inside `<mark>` (<mark>Opening</mark>) and `</mark>` (<mark>Closing</mark>) HTML Tag.

## Super<sup>script</sup>
This is a <sup>superscript</sup> - To make some text appear in
superscript, wrap the text inside `<sup>`(<sup>Opening</sup>) and `</sup>` (<sup>Closing</sup>) 
HTML Tags.

## Sub<sub>script</sub>
This is a <sub>subscript</sub> - To make some text appear in
subscript, wrap the text inside `<sub>`(<sub>Opening</sub>) and `</sub>` (<sub>Closing</sub>) 
HTML Tags. 

## `CODE`
`This is inline code` - To wrap text/code inline, wrap your text beteen single `` ` ``. 

## ``` CODE BLOCK ```
```python
    # This is a code block
    a = 1
    for i in range(5):
        print(a+i) 
    
    # To wrap code within a code block, 
    # wrap the text within ```.
``` 
## [Links](https://aanshsamyani.github.io/)
[This is a link](https://aanshsamyani.github.io/) - To create a link, Wrap the text to be displayed within `[]` and next to it wrap the
url within `()`. Example:

`[Text to be displayed](URL1)`

## ![Images](../images/Blog1-image.png)

To insert an image, start with an exclamation, wrap the Alt-text of the image within `[]` and wrap the image path within `()` next to it. Example:

`![Alt-text](/path/to/image)`

## Horizontal Rule/Divider

This is above horizontal rule.
***
This is below horizontal rule

To insert a horizontal rule, use `***` (three asterisks) between the two lines.

## Tables

To create a table you need to create a list of rows where each column is separated by a | and each row starts and ends with a | as well. Below the first row you need to add a row where each column consists of at least three -s and optionally a : character on either side of the -s. The : character is used to align the text in the column. If you add a : character on the left side of the -s then the text will be left aligned. If you add a : character on the right side of the -s then the text will be right aligned. If you add a : character on both sides of the -s then the text will be center aligned. Finally, you can continue to add rows to your table with the same format as your first row. Example:

|Col1 |Col2   |
|-----|-------|
|This |is     |
|an   |example|
|of   |a      |
|table|.      |
